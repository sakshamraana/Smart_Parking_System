Smart Parking System ðŸš—ðŸ“¶
An IoT-based Smart Parking System designed to monitor real-time parking slot availability, reduce urban traffic congestion, and support smart city infrastructure with sensor-based data collection.

ðŸ”§ Project Scope
Real-Time Slot Monitoring
Detects and displays real-time parking slot status (occupied/vacant) using IR or proximity sensors.

User-Friendly Interface
Web or mobile dashboard for users to check slot availability in selected parking areas.

Sensor-Based Detection
Utilizes IR sensors and microcontrollers (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) for accurate vehicle detection.

Cloud-Connected Storage
Live slot data is uploaded to a centralized cloud database for instant access.

Admin Dashboard
Admins can monitor, manage slots, and generate usage reports for planning.

Urban Traffic Optimization
Helps reduce time spent searching for parking, easing city traffic flow.

Smart City Integration
Collects historical parking data to assist urban development and traffic management.

Modular & Scalable Design
Easily adaptable from small private lots to large multi-level parking facilities.

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino / Raspberry Pi, IR Sensors, Servo Motors, LCD Display

Connectivity: ESP8266 / ESP32, Wi-Fi

Database: Firebase / Cloud-based service

Frontend: Web dashboard / Mobile app (optional)

Backend: REST APIs / Firebase integration

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
